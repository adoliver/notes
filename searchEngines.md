# Search Engine Knowledge
This will document some of the more confusing aspects of search engines and a place I can refer to to double check I am not doing something silly.

## Edge Cases
### Canonical and No Index meta tags
Google has stated around 2014 that having both a canonical and no index meta tag on the same page can confuse the web crawler. The preference will be to use a canonical link to indicate that the current url shouldn't be indexed. Look at manual removal if the url doesn't get removed.

### Manually remove indexed pages
Google has tools to manually direct the webcrawler to remove urls from its index. Have not used these yet.
